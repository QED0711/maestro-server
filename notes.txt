1. Ping all players multiple times with the server time. Each client will determine their average latency from the server based on their time
2. The server sends a play message with the epoch time to begin playing. The play message also includes the json play file. Each client translates the start time of the performance given their latency/time difference, and begins a countdown to the performance start. 
3. the json file only has relative times between events (e.g. 500ms). So long as the start times are close enough to being synched, each client becomes responsible for keeping their own time.
